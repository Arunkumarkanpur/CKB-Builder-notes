# Builder Track – Weekly Progress Report

##  Progress This Week

---

##  Overview
This repository contains my **weekly learning progress report** for the **Builder Track (Week 09)**.  
During this week, I focused on advanced scripting and performance optimization techniques in **CKB (Nervos)** using **Duktape JavaScript** and **WebAssembly (WASM)**.

##  Topics Covered

###  Class 7 – Advanced Duktape Scripts
In this class, I learned how to build advanced and real-world smart contracts using JavaScript on CKB.

**Key Learnings:**
- Writing complex CKB scripts using **JavaScript (Duktape)**  
- Using **external libraries** in scripts  
- Concepts of **serialization and hashing**  
- Debugging tools for smart contracts  
- Built an example **HTLC-style smart contract** using JavaScript

###  Class 8 – Performant WASM
This class focused on improving performance by running **high-performance WebAssembly code** on CKB.

**Key Learnings:**
- Running optimized **WASM code** on CKB  
- Understanding the **WASM → RISC-V compilation pipeline**  
- Performance benefits of using WASM  
- Writing optimized scripts using:
  - **AssemblyScript**
  - **Rust (via WASI)**
