# Builder Track – Weekly Progress Report


## Weekly Progress Report

---

##  Objective
The goal of this week was to learn the **basics of writing and running CKB smart contracts** using:
- **Rust**
- **JavaScript (ckb-js-vm)**


---

##  Topics Covered

###  Rust Script – Quick Start
- Learned how to set up the **Rust environment** for CKB scripting.
- Generated a new CKB script project using official templates.
- Wrote a simple **Hello World smart contract** using `ckb-std`.
- Compiled the contract using the RISC-V toolchain.
- Tested and debugged the script using **ckb-debugger** and **ckb-testtool**.

**Skills Gained:**
- Rust-based CKB contract development  
- Script compilation and debugging  
- Understanding CKB execution flow  

---

###  JavaScript Script – Quick Start
- Learned how JavaScript can run inside **CKB-VM** using `ckb-js-vm`.
- Executed a simple JavaScript script using **ckb-debugger**.
- Set up a **TypeScript-based CKB script project**.
- Understood how JavaScript scripts are used for quick prototyping on CKB.

**Skills Gained:**
- Running JS scripts in CKB-VM  
- Using JavaScript for rapid smart contract prototyping  

---

##  Key Learnings
- **Rust scripts** provide better performance and are suitable for production-level smart contracts.
- **JavaScript scripts** are easier to write and ideal for learning and experimentation.
- Both languages are supported by CKB, allowing flexibility for developers.

---

##  Outcome
- Successfully learned how to run basic smart contracts using Rust and JavaScript.
- Gained confidence in using CKB debugging and testing tools.
- Built a strong foundation for advanced CKB script development.

---

##  Next Week Goals
- Deploy a CKB smart contract on Devnet  
- Compare performance between Rust and JavaScript scripts  
- Write and test real-world contract logic
